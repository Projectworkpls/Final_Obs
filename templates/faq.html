        ("What is Sanjaya – The Observer?", "Sanjaya is a child-centric program that quietly observes and understands a child’s learning journey—beyond textbooks—so parents and schools get balanced, unbiased insights and timely guidance."),
        ("Who leads the initiative?", "The program is built under the wisdom and supervision of experienced school principals, with leadership from a founder/principal who has a background in child psychology and education."),
        ("How does the program work, in simple terms?", "We gather gentle observations and inputs from home and school, synthesize learning, behavior, and wellbeing patterns, and share practical, age-appropriate recommendations with parents and educators."),
        ("Who is it for (age groups)?", "For preschool and school-age children, adapting by age—focusing first on attachment and play, later on habits, peers, and study skills."),
        ("Is this a clinical assessment or therapy?", "No. Sanjaya is an observation-based guidance program—not a diagnosis or therapy. If specialist help is needed, we suggest qualified referrals with your consent."),
        ("What kind of concerns can it help with?", "Daily routines, emotions, peer issues, screen time, focus and homework habits, transitions, and home–school communication."),
        ("What are the benefits for schools?", "Clearer child profiles, early behavioral flags, smoother teacher–parent conversations, and practical classroom insights."),
        ("What will parents receive?", "A concise insight note with 3–5 suggested actions for home/school, followed by a short check-in."),
        ("How long does it take?", "A typical cycle includes onboarding, 1–2 weeks of observation, a feedback session, and a follow-up."),
        ("How do you handle privacy and consent?", "We collect minimal information, take written consent, and never share child data with third parties. Notes are accessible only to authorized adults."),
        ("Will this add pressure on my child?", "No. Observations blend naturally into routines—play, school, and home life—designed to be child-friendly and non-intrusive."),
        ("Can Sanjaya work with my child’s teacher or counsellor?", "Yes, we coordinate with your school team for consistent, practical guidance."),
        ("Do you support children with special needs?", "We provide supportive observations and day-to-day strategies, referring to professionals if specialized care is required."),
        ("Is it online, offline, or hybrid?", "Currently, the program operates fully online."),
        ("How do we enroll?", "Schools can onboard grades or cohorts; parents can express interest individually. Contact: <strong>8291188188</strong>.")
