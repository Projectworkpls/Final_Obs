        ("Who leads the initiative?", "The program is built under the wisdom and supervision of experienced school principals, with leadership from a founder/principal who has a background in child psychology and education."),
        ("How does the program work, in simple terms?", "We gather gentle observations and inputs from child's sharing, synthesize learning, behavior, and wellbeing, and share practical, age-appropriate recommendations with parents."),
        ("Who is it for (age groups)?", "It is for the children of age group 5-18 years."),
        ("Is this a clinical assessment or therapy?", "No. Sanjaya is a listening and observation based guidance program, not a diagnosis or therapy. If specialist help is needed, we provide qualified referrals with your consent."),
        ("What kind of concerns can it help with?", "Daily routines, emotions, peer issues, screen time, focus and homework habits, transitions, communication, creativity, physical activity, independence, planning, and other soft-skill areas."),
        ("What will parents receive?", "A concise insight report with recommendation to parents."),
        ("How long does it take?", "A typical cycle includes onboarding, 1–2 weeks of observation, a feedback session, and a follow-up."),
        ("How do you handle privacy and consent?", "We collect minimal information, take written consent, and never share child data with third parties. Growth reports are accessible only to parents."),
        ("Will this add pressure on my child?", "No. Observations blend naturally into a child’s daily activity which is designed to be child friendly and non-intrusive."),
        ("Can Sanjaya work with my child’s teacher or counsellor?", "No. We don’t coordinate directly with teachers or counsellors."),
        ("Do you support children with special needs?", "We provide supportive observations and day-to-day strategies, referring to professionals if specialized care is required."),
        ("Is it online, offline, or hybrid?", "Currently, the program operates fully online."),
        ("How do we enroll?", "Schools can onboard grades or cohorts; parents can express interest individually. Contact: <strong>8291188188</strong>.")
